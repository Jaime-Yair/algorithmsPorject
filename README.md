# Omnidroid Cost Calculator


This project implements a memoized dynamic programming algorithm to calculate the total sprocket cost required to construct an omnidroid. The omnidroid is built from a hierarchical structure of parts, each of which may depend on other parts for its construction.

The program reads an input file containing the details of the omnidroid's parts and dependencies, computes the total cost, and outputs the result in a specified format.
